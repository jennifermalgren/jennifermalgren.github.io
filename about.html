  <p>Hello! I'm Jennifer Malgren, a multi-faceted environmental scientist passionate about climate innovation and sustainability. I focus on data-driven solutions and systems thinking to tackle environmental challenges.</p>

  <p>I was born and raised in the Bay Area and began my academic journey at the College of San Mateo, where I earned an Associate of Arts in Business Administration in 2016. After some thoughtful exploration of what I wanted in a career, I discovered a deep interest in environmental science and policy. That same year, I packed my bags and moved to Oregon to pursue a dual degree at Portland State University. At PSU, my studies focused on freshwater quality and environmental policy. I was particularly drawn to how science and governance intersect to shape real-world outcomes. In 2019, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies & Science, complemented by a minor in Geography.</p>

  <p>After graduation, I transitioned out of a sales role and into the environmental field, starting as a high-level administrative assistant at an environmental testing laboratory. Over time, I advanced to become the laboratory director, where I oversaw operations, quality systems, and regulatory compliance. Alongside this, I also worked in the Watershed Management section at the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), working on a new method of TMDL modeling that utilized Bayesian Nets and probability modeling over traditional models like QUAL2K.</p>

  <p>Although I was thriving in technical roles, I found myself longing for a creative outlet. I’ve always felt energized at the intersection of data and creativity. I decided to pursue a certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing through Cal Poly Humboldt, a school with deep personal significance to me and a strong reputation for environmental science. I completed the program in early 2024.</p>

  <p>After six years in Portland, I was ready for a new environment (and sunnier skies). In 2024, shortly after finishing my GIS certification, I accepted a position with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Two weeks later, I was in a U-Haul heading for Austin, excited to begin a new chapter in the Lone Star State.</p>

  <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, walking my Catahoula Leopard Dog Oliver, exercising, and exploring new restaurants and neighborhoods.</p>
